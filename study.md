## Ember Routing

How does Ember use the URL to load view-state? Which layers in Ember are
responsible for which tasks?

```md
The paths represent a fixed model and, depending on the situation, a single
post within that model. It returns the model hook as a model property of the
controller.
```

## Deploying Ember

What are hash URLs? What do you have to be aware of when using GitHub pages for
your deployed Ember app? What do you need if you want to use the `history` API
instead of `hash` for `location`?

```md
Hash URL: Uses anchors for loading the default state of the app and keep it
synchronized as you navigate through the app.
Example: /#/photos/new takes you to photos.new route.

What to be aware of?: Must be aware of location type when deploying Ember app.
For deploying to Github, it must be set to hash. If you want to use the history
API, set location to history.

```
